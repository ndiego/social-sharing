## Development

1. Run `npm install` to install the plugin's dependencies within a `/node_modules/` folder.
2. Run `composer install` to install the additional WordPress composer tools within a `/vendor/` folder.
3. Make sure you have Docker installed and run `npm run dev:start`. This will startup an integrated local development environment. See [@wordpress/env documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) for details.
4. Run `npm run start` to compile and watch source files for changes while developing.

Refer to `package.json` and `composer.json` for additional commands.
